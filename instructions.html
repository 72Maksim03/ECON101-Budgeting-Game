  <h1 class="mb-4">How to Play the Budgeting Game</h1>

  <p>In this budgeting simulation, you will manage a fictional person's finances over 12 months, divided into 4 weeks each. Your goal is to maintain a balance between spending, saving, and investing while keeping your health and entertainment levels up.</p>

  <h3>Basic Gameplay:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly Salary:</strong> You receive a fixed salary at the start of each month.</li>
    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Choose a housing option each month and pay the rent. Missing rent means losing the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Select how you commute — public transport or buy/use a car. Cars must be purchased first.</li>
    <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Use money to maintain your entertainment level, which affects your health.</li>
    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Manage your health by balancing spending and using hospital services if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Investments:</strong> You can invest money to earn returns monthly.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt:</strong> You may take loans but be careful — interest accrues every two weeks, and debt over $2000 ends the game.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Events:</strong> Random events may affect your money, health, or entertainment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You must pay your rent every month or the game ends immediately.</li>
    <li>Entertainment drops each week depending on your housing and transportation choices.</li>
    <li>If your entertainment drops too low, your health will also deteriorate.</li>
    <li>Health below a critical level may force hospital visits, reducing your salary temporarily.</li>
    <li>Gym and streaming subscriptions can help maintain your entertainment and health levels but come at a monthly cost.</li>
    <li>Balance your spending wisely to avoid debt and stay healthy.</li>
  </ul>
