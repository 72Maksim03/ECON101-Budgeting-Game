  <h1>Economics Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h3>Inflation</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Inflation</strong> is the steady increase in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy, which reduces the purchasing power of money. As inflation rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services—meaning your salary may not go as far as it used to.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Groceries Spike</strong> – A simulated inflation event might increase your food and essentials cost by 20% for a few weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Rent Surge</strong> – Housing costs may rise, making you rethink your lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Eroded Savings</strong> – Inflation reduces the value of money saved without investing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Post‑COVID Inflation</strong> – Supply chain issues and high demand caused prices to rise globally.</li>
      <li><strong>1970s Oil Shock</strong> – Energy prices surged, causing years of high inflation and slow growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Learning to manage spending and seek smart investments is key to staying ahead of inflation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Recession</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>recession</strong> is a period of economic decline typically marked by reduced GDP, rising unemployment, and weak spending. It impacts households and businesses, leading to layoffs, lower wages, and increased financial pressure.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pay Cuts</strong> – Salaries may drop during recession events.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Losses</strong> – Assets like stocks may yield negative returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher Random Costs</strong> – Unexpected expenses rise, while bonuses drop.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2008 Financial Crisis</strong> – A global downturn sparked by housing market collapse.</li>
      <li><strong>2020 COVID Recession</strong> – A sharp, sudden decline in economic activity due to lockdowns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Managing debt, building cash reserves, and staying adaptable can help weather tough times.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Opportunity Cost</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> is the value of the next best alternative you give up when you make a choice. Every decision has a trade-off.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rent vs. Investment</strong> – Spending more on housing might leave you with less to invest.</li>
      <li><strong>Entertainment vs. Health</strong> – Skipping fun may save money, but could reduce your health score.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to college means giving up full-time income for long-term career benefits.</li>
      <li>Buying a car now may delay saving for a house later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Smart budgeting involves weighing what you gain vs. what you sacrifice.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Budget Constraint</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>budget constraint</strong> is the limit of what you can afford based on your income and prices. You can't spend more than you earn without going into debt.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Each round, you must allocate limited income across rent, food, health, and savings.</li>
      <li>Overspending forces you to borrow, which can lead to debt spirals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Households must cut discretionary spending when essential costs rise.</li>
      <li>Governments also face budget limits, affecting policy decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Budgeting teaches discipline and helps avoid financial stress.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Utility Maximization</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Utility</strong> refers to satisfaction or happiness from consuming goods or services. Utility maximization is about getting the most value for your limited budget.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing low-cost, high-impact items (like gym membership) to boost health.</li>
      <li>Spending wisely on fun to keep morale up while staying solvent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Consumers compare price and enjoyment when choosing between Netflix and going out.</li>
      <li>People shift spending when prices change, to maintain satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Maximizing utility helps balance joy and responsibility.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Emergency Funds</h3>
    <p>
      An <strong>emergency fund</strong> is money saved to cover unexpected expenses—like car repairs or medical bills—so you don’t go into debt.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Random events may force you to pay large sums; emergency savings reduce impact.</li>
      <li>Players without savings must take loans, risking game over.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Experts recommend saving 3–6 months of living expenses.</li>
      <li>Emergency funds help people avoid high-interest debt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Being financially prepared helps reduce stress and increases resilience.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Risk & Uncertainty</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Risk</strong> involves known probabilities of outcomes. <strong>Uncertainty</strong> means outcomes are unknown or unpredictable. Both affect economic decisions.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Investments carry risk—you might gain or lose.</li>
      <li>Events like sickness or bonuses are uncertain but influence strategy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock markets fluctuate based on known risks (interest rates) and unknowns (war, pandemic).</li>
      <li>Insurance exists to protect against risk (e.g., car crashes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Understanding risk helps you make smarter decisions and prepare for surprises.</p>
