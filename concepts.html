  <h1>Economics Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h3>Inflation</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Inflation</strong> is the steady increase in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy, which reduces the purchasing power of money. As inflation rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services—meaning your salary may not go as far as it used to.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Groceries Spike</strong> – A simulated inflation event might increase your food and essentials cost by 20% for a few weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Rent Surge</strong> – Housing costs may rise, making you rethink your lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Eroded Savings</strong> – Inflation reduces the value of money saved without investing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Post‑COVID Inflation</strong> – Supply chain issues and high demand caused prices to rise globally.</li>
      <li><strong>1970s Oil Shock</strong> – Energy prices surged, causing years of high inflation and slow growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Learning to manage spending and seek smart investments is key to staying ahead of inflation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Recession</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>recession</strong> is a broad, sustained decline in economic activity—typically defined as two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP—accompanied by rising unemployment, weaker consumer spending, and lower business investment. During a recession, households and firms earn less, credit becomes scarcer, and confidence drops, creating a feedback loop that further depresses growth.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pay‑Cut Shock</strong> – A “recession” event might dock your monthly salary by 15 % for three months, forcing you to re‑evaluate rent, entertainment, and investment choices</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Slump</strong> – Stock or crypto investments could post negative returns during the downturn, testing your ability to stay solvent without sliding into debt</li>
      <li><strong>Job Market Freeze</strong> – An in‑game recession could double the odds of random costs (e.g., appliance repairs) while halving the chance of positive windfalls, simulating tighter budgets and lower confidence.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Great Recession (2007‑09)</strong> – Triggered by the U.S. housing‑finance collapse, global GDP contracted, unemployment spiked, and many workers faced wage cuts or layoffs.</li>
      <li><strong>COVID‑19 Recession (2020)</strong> – Pandemic‑driven shutdowns pushed service sectors into free fall, slashing incomes and forcing unprecedented fiscal‑monetary rescue packages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Managing debt, building cash reserves, and staying adaptable can help weather tough times.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Opportunity Cost</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> is the value of the next best alternative you give up when you make a choice. Every decision has a trade-off.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rent vs. Investment</strong> – Spending more on housing might leave you with less to invest.</li>
      <li><strong>Entertainment vs. Health</strong> – Skipping fun may save money, but could reduce your health score.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to college means giving up full-time income for long-term career benefits.</li>
      <li>Buying a car now may delay saving for a house later.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> In both the game and real life, successfully navigating a recession hinges on liquidity (cash reserves), prudent debt levels, and flexibility in spending—exactly the skills the Budgeting Game is designed to develop.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Budget Constraint</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>budget constraint</strong> is the limit of what you can afford based on your income and prices. You can't spend more than you earn without going into debt.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Each round, you must allocate limited income across rent, food, health, and savings.</li>
      <li>Overspending forces you to borrow, which can lead to debt spirals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Households must cut discretionary spending when essential costs rise.</li>
      <li>Governments also face budget limits, affecting policy decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Budgeting teaches discipline and helps avoid financial stress.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Utility Maximization</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Utility</strong> refers to satisfaction or happiness from consuming goods or services. Utility maximization is about getting the most value for your limited budget.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing low-cost, high-impact items (like gym membership) to boost health.</li>
      <li>Spending wisely on fun to keep morale up while staying solvent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Consumers compare price and enjoyment when choosing between Netflix and going out.</li>
      <li>People shift spending when prices change, to maintain satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Maximizing utility helps balance joy and responsibility.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Emergency Funds</h3>
    <p>
      An <strong>emergency fund</strong> is money saved to cover unexpected expenses—like car repairs or medical bills—so you don’t go into debt.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Random events may force you to pay large sums; emergency savings reduce impact.</li>
      <li>Players without savings must take loans, risking game over.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Experts recommend saving 3–6 months of living expenses.</li>
      <li>Emergency funds help people avoid high-interest debt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Being financially prepared helps reduce stress and increases resilience.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Risk & Uncertainty</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Risk</strong> involves known probabilities of outcomes. <strong>Uncertainty</strong> means outcomes are unknown or unpredictable. Both affect economic decisions.
    </p>
    <h5>Inside the Budgeting Game:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Investments carry risk—you might gain or lose.</li>
      <li>Events like sickness or bonuses are uncertain but influence strategy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Real-World Examples:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock markets fluctuate based on known risks (interest rates) and unknowns (war, pandemic).</li>
      <li>Insurance exists to protect against risk (e.g., car crashes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Understanding risk helps you make smarter decisions and prepare for surprises.</p>
